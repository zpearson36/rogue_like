Things left to do

Character:
 - Character level progression/experiance collection
 - - make enemies worth experience when killed
 - - level progression system
 - - - based strictly on gained experience?
 - - - based on level up key/major skills?
 - - - do skills automatically increase at level up or does player choose what to increase?

Items:
 - Weapons
 - - Need More
 - - Additional Stats (Damage type, magic/elemental?)
 - - Upgrade Paths
 - - - add upgrade materials
 - - - upgrade effects?
 - - Diablo type loot system? (Does upgrade paths with this type of loot system work?)
 - Consumable Items
 - - potions for health, strength, invis, etc
 - Armor
 - - armor will work as damage reduction. Greater armor proficiency == greater chance for max damage reduction
 - - armor protects against different damage types

Environment:
 - dynamic lighting
 - more consistent dungeon generation
 - - currently, does not do rectangular rooms, but single cave-like dungeons
 - - want to include different environments/biomes
 - key areas/rooms remain the same between runs (bosses/key item levels/etc)
 - - these areas unlock shortcuts back to them so player does not have to treck through

Enemies:
 - add enemy variations
 - add loot drops (idealy diablo like loot drops, but might require item rework. Maybe random drops like DS)

Magic:
 - add magic and sorceries

non-enemy NPCs:
 - add dialogue system
 - add merchant system (buy and sell)
 - add weapon upgrade dialogue (weapon upgrades happen at specific NPCs)

Story:
 - Create Story

UI:
 - Need HUD
 - Need Better and consistent Menus
