Each Skill stat will be associated with 1 or more primary stats. This will have various affects. For
one, The associate primary stat will determine what the base value for the skills are  - the higher
the primary stat, the higher the base skill stat. Additionally, as one increases proficiency in a
skill, the associate primary skills will gain experience allowing them to increase over time.

The skill stats will provide modifiers to action rolls that will help determine the outcome. The
higher the stat, the higher the modifier, the better chances of success. The primary stats will also
provide a benefit once an action has been determined to be successful (I.E. A high skill in long
blade makes it more likely that you'll strike your opponent, but the damage amount is modified by
your strength stat - High strength means more damage)

Health is determined directly by endurance. Each level, health is increased in proportion to the
characters endurance.

Max equip load is determined by Strength. Each level, Max equip load is increased in proportion to
the characters strength

Equip load affects movement speed (maybe) and ability to dodge attacks.
